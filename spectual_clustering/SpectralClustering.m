function [ C, L, U ] = SpectralClustering( W, k, kmean,Type )
%SPECTRALCLUSTERING Executes spectral clustering algorithm
%   Executes the spectral clustering algorithm defined by
%   Type on the adjacency matrix W and returns the k cluster
%   indicator vectors as columns in C.
%   If L and U are also called, the (normalized) Laplacian and
%   eigenvectors will also be returned.
%
%   'W' - Adjacency matrix, needs to be square
%   'k' - Number of clusters to look for
%   'Type' - Defines the type of spectral clustering algorithm
%            that should be used. Choices are:
%      1 - Unnormalized
%      2 - Normalized according to Shi and Malik (2000)
%      3 - Normalized according to Jordan and Weiss (2002)
